Here's my flutter drone ecommerce application based on the specifications given by speak nigeria
Was asked to add these attributes respectively. Tag or id,  weight capacity, manufacturer, services or
not serviced and date of acquisition.
Was abel to add a few being i'm a newbie to flutter. Was able to build the ui based on a research i 
did on ecommerce uis on dribble so i followed.
i created a welcome screen asleep, added a button and added a route of navigator.push also.
which moved the user to the product page.
Then created an object model in drone model page also added it's properties and constructors too,
made it required so i can add these properties.
also created a list so i can add multiple items with different data's.
created a listview builder on my product page to list out these items. and finally created a floating
buttons a navigator.pop so as to take the user back to the welcome screen.
was going to create the details page but couldn't because of time given.
I know i'm still learning and i can learn so much wit you. Hope this gets to you.
